Join us our inaugural meet up in Belfast!  We are pleased to announce that 
[Naeem Sarfraz](https://twitter.com/naeemsarfraz) will join us as our very
first speaker!

Naeem is an independent Software Engineer & Architect currently working 
on distributed systems in healthcare. Over the past few years his particular
interests lie in using domain-driven design and event-driven architectures
to meet complex demands and deliver scalable solutions. At other times 
you'll find him riding horses, firing arrows, and occasionally both at the
same time.

We are looking for sponsors for food and a venue.  If you are interested
please get in touch on twitter at [@{{ site.twitter_username }}](https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }})!
