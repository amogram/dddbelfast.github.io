Join us for our March meetup 

Join us for our March meetup hosted at Ormeau Baths.  This month we will have [Duncan Jones](https://twitter.com/merrion) giving us an introduction to the idea of “Event Sourcing” and discussion of how you can use it 
as the basis for a distributed system.

The emphasis will be on the underlying ideas rather than focusing on a specific framework or language.
It is a beginner level talk with almost no code but mostly diagrams, discussion (and maybe Lego).
